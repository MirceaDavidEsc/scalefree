Description: This package contains functions that allow for the analysis of
    spatial correlations in collective moving systems. This package is useful for
    analysis of fluctuations, measuring the correlation length of collective systems,
    their susceptibility. The goal of this package is to enable a biophysics analysis of collective behavior,
    as developed by researchers such as William Bialek, Andrea Cavagna, Tamas Vicsek, among others.
